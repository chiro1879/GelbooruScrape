# Gelbooru Scraper

This is a scraper for Gelbooru made in Python that took about 1-2 days to program. I hope you enjoy it!

## How to run:
1. Install `python-dotenv` and `pygelbooru`
2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`
3. Replace the API Key and User ID inside `.env` with your own Gelbooru Key and User ID. it can be found in `My Account` > `Options` > `API Access Credentials`
4. Replace the tags and exclude tags to whatever you want. multiple tags should be separated by a comma (`,`)
5. Run `python gel.py`
